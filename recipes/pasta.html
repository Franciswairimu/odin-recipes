    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Boil water</strong></li>
        <p>Fill a large pot with water, leaving enough room for the pasta to expand while cooking. Add salt to the water if desired, as it can enhance the flavor of the pasta. Bring the water to a rolling boil over high heat.</p>
        <li><strong>Add pasta</strong></li>
        <p>Once the water is boiling, add the pasta to the pot. Stir gently to prevent the pasta from sticking together.</p>
        <li><strong>Cook pasta</strong></li>
        <p>Follow the package instructions for cooking time, usually around 8-12 minutes depending on the type and thickness of the pasta. Stir occasionally to ensure even cooking.</p>
        <li><strong>Check for doneness</strong></li>
        <p>Taste a piece of pasta to check if it's cooked to your liking. It should be tender but still slightly firm (al dente). If it's too firm, continue cooking for another minute or two.</p>
        <li><strong>Drain pasta</strong></li>
        <p>Once the pasta is cooked, turn off the heat and carefully drain it in a colander or use a slotted spoon to remove it from the water. Do not rinse the pasta, as this removes the starch that helps sauces adhere to it.</p>
        <li><strong>Serve</strong></li>
        <p>Transfer the drained pasta to a serving dish or individual plates. If using sauce, you can either toss the pasta with the sauce in the pot or pour the sauce over the pasta on the plates. Optionally, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with grated cheese or fresh herbs for added flavor.

        </p>
        <li><strong>Enjoy</strong></li>
        <p>Serve the pasta immediately while it's still hot, and enjoy your delicious meal!</p>
